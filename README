# about

  an experiment in minimal yet effective syntax highlighting that aims to
  remove the need to separately configure terminal and nvim colourschemes.

  - note

  this colourscheme requires the vim-polyglot plugin [1], this is because
  vim-polyglot adds a bunch additional new highlight groups, quite a few of
  which are modified in this colourscheme.

# optimization

  check out some of my palettes [2] for the optimal colour setup, but tl;dr
  make sure colour 8 is light enough to be used a comment and that colour 0 is
  barely lighter than the background. Whites should get incrementally darker
  but that's not nearly as important as the blacks. bright colours (excluding
  grayscale) aren't necessary and can just be duplicated if you can't be
  bothered to increase shades manually, they aren't used in the colourscheme

  most base16 compliant colourschemes should work just fine, note that color 8
  and 0 may have to be shifted slightly in order to achieve nicer grays. You
  can do this easily using shell scripts or a website like colorhexa [3].

# install

  $ cp clr/mnml.vim $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim/colors/ # ~/.config for macOS

  in 'init.vim:'

  colorscheme mnml

# todo

  * use c_red for erratic code
  * italics and underlines could be handy
