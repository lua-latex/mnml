mnml

--- about

  an experiment in minimal yet effective syntax highlighting that aims to
  remove the need to separately configure terminal and nvim colourschemes.

  note
  ----

  all highlighting is done using 'cterm' attributes and is reliant only on how
  well your terminal colours are configured.

--- optimization

  check out some of my palettes [1] for the optimal colour setup, but tl;dr
  make sure colour 8 is light enough to be used a comment and that colour 0 is
  barely lighter than the background. Whites should get incrementally darker
  but that's not nearly as important as the blacks. bright colours (excluding
  grayscale) aren't necessary and can just be duplicated if you can't be
  bothered to increase shades manually, they aren't used in the colourscheme

  [1] <https://0x0.st/Nl7L>

  most base16 compliant colourschemes should work just fine, note that color 8
  and 0 may have to be shifted slightly in order to achieve nicer grays. You can
  do this easily using shell scripts or a website like <https://colorhexa.com>.

--- install

  $ cp clr/mnml.vim $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim/colors/ # ~/.config for macOS

  in init.vim:
