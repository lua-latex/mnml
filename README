mnml

--- about

  an experiment in minimal yet effective syntax highlighting that is
  independent of actual terminal colourscheme.

  note
  ----

  all highlighting is done using 'cterm' attributes and is reliant only on how
  well your terminal colours are configured.

--- optimization

  check out some of my palettes [1] for the optimal colour setup, but tl;dr
  make sure colour 8 is light enough to be used a comment and that colour 0 is
  barely lighter than the background. Whites should get incrementally darker
  but that's not nearly as important as the blacks. bright colours (excluding
  grayscale) aren't necessary and can just be duplicated if you can't be
  bothered to increase shades manually, they aren't used in the colourscheme
